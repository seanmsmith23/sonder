## Welcome to Sonder

Sonder is my personal project for gSchool. The goal of the project is to use modern design
and web technologies to improve online memorials.

## Getting Started

Fork/clone the project and run `bundle`.
Run:
 `rake db:create
 rake db:migrate
 rake db:seed`

Then you can either use the example login that prints to the console (from seed file)
or create a new user and login.
